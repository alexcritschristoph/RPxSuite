# TODO

### Immediately necessary

* Print results to file instead of printing to screen

* Show the cluster of all sequences, not just the winner

* Default to using nucleotide, not amino acid

* Use the thresholds described in the publication

### Future upgrades

* Ability to use custom HMMs

* Gene length filtering

* Better output directory (subdirectories with less important files)

* Ability to input a list of assemblies and their filename

* Better handleing of choosing the gene you want. The ability to print a description table would be ideal

* Change vsearch clustering parameters
